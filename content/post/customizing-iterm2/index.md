I've found this tutorial [here at freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-configure-your-macos-terminal-with-zsh-like-a-pro-c0ab3f3c1156/) very useful to install and customize iTerm2 in my mac. I have followed almost all of the steps, except the color customization options, where I chose to use [material-design by Martin Seeler](https://github.com/MartinSeeler/iterm2-material-design). I also liked [_Dracula for dark theme_](https://draculatheme.com/iterm/).
