A list of basic terminologies frequently used with security & privacy related discussions/articles/research papers

1. **Principal** : A legitimate actor of any system.
2. **Credential(s)** : An artifact(s) to provide identity.
3. **Authentication** : The process through which an identity is associated with some principal.
4. **Authorization** : A set of rights/permissions which a principal possesses.
5. **Threat** : A specific means by which an attacker can put a system at risk.
6. **Threat model** : A collection of threats that is deemed important for a particular environment. It can also be thought as a collection of attacker(s) abilities.
7. **Vulnerability** : A systematic artifact that exposes the user, data, or system to a _threat_. Vulnerabilities are also known as _attack vectors_ which an adversary (bad guy(s)) use to compromise a system. Common sources of vulnerability could be bad software/hardware design, bad policy/configuration, system misuse etc.
8. **Attack** : An occurrence where a vulnerability is exploited by an adversary. When an attack is successful, we call it as a _compromise_.
9. **Trust** : An expectation from a principal to act in an anticipated manner.
10. **Trust model** : An explicit assessment of the trust embodied in a system.
11. **Security model** : A combination of a trust and threat models that address the set of perceived risks along with security requirements.
12. [Confidentiality vs Privacy](https://securitytoday.com/articles/2014/05/23/what-everyone-should-know-about-privacy-security-and-confidentiality.aspx): Privacy applies to the person while confidentiality applies to the data ([more here](https://research.uci.edu/compliance/human-research-protections/docs/privacy-confidentiality-hrp.pdf)).
