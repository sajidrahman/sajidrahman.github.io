My name is Sajidur Rahman, commonly called as *'Sajid'* (pronounced as 'SA-ZID'). I am a graduate research assistant working in the **Institute for Cybersecurity Research Center at University of Florida**. I am co-advised by Profs. [Vincent Bindschaedler](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/bindschaedler-vincent/) and [Byron Williams](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/williams-byron/). 

My research work intersects the following cross-cutting areas:

- Security and Privacy Engineering
- Deep Learning
- Human-centered Computing

I completed M.Sc in  [Computer Science at Kansas State University](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/) under supervision of [Prof. Eugene Vasserman](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~eyv/) and B.Sc degree in Computer Science from [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)](http://www.buet.ac.bd/). In my previous life, I worked as a Software Engineer in the fintech industry for over 4+ years. During this period, I led and implemented projects such as a centralized MIS system for a large commercial bank, architecting and implementing a mobile payment engine at [SureCash](https://www.surecash.net/), which is still being used full-steam today and now one of the [largest mobile banking providers in Bangladesh](https://academy.smu.edu.sg/insights/surecash-promoting-financial-inclusion-bangladesh-3606).
