If the List consists of built-in class objects, e.g. String, Integer, Long, Date, Character, File etc., then the objects will be sorted in a way of natural ordering of that class. But for objects from custom classes, our class needs to either implement Comparable interface or it can implement Comparator interface to provide a custom comparator for Collections.sort(list, comparator) method. The following example is adapted from Oracle\u0026rsquo;s tutorial page.  import java.util.*; public class EmpSort { //we can either define a comparator here static final Comparator\u0026lt;Employee\u0026gt; SENIORITY_ORDER = new Comparator\u0026lt;Employee\u0026gt;() { public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) { return e2.hireDate().compareTo(e1.hireDate()); } }; // Employee database static final Collection\u0026lt;Employee\u0026gt; employees = ... ; public static void main(String[] args) { List\u0026lt;Employee\u0026gt; employeeList = new ArrayList\u0026lt;Employee\u0026gt;(employees); //Collections.sort(employeeList, SENIORITY_ORDER); // Or we can define comparator in-line with the sort method, as shown below @Override Collections.sort(employeeList, new Comparator\u0026lt;Employee\u0026gt;() { public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) { return e2.hireDate().compareTo(e1.hireDate()); } }); System.out.println(employeeList); } }  Similar to List, java.util.Arrays also provides convenient sort() method for ordering primitive data types. For example, the following example sorts an integer array in O(n log(n)). The sort method here implements a [dual-pivot Quicksort](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#sort(int[]) algorithm.  import java.util.Arrays; public class SortExample { public static void main(String[] args) { int[] arr = {13, 77, 609, 45, 21, 9, 101, 102, -101, 30}; Arrays.sort(arr); System.out.printf(\u0026quot;Modified arr[] : %s\u0026quot;, Arrays.toString(arr)); } }  Conversion  String to Character array:  String string = \u0026quot;Hello world!\u0026quot;; char[] stringToCharArray = string.toCharArray();  ","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605225600,"objectID":"61f789a5984f2f71a395e1e6a2b43db8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/useful-java-functions/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/useful-java-functions/","section":"post","summary":"Miscellaneous and Handy Java Functions","tags":["Java","Miscellaneous","Functions"],"title":"Miscellaneous and Handy Java Functions","type":"post"},{"authors":["Sajid Rahman"],"categories":["What-is"],"content":"A list of basic terminologies frequently used with security \u0026amp; privacy related discussions/articles/research papers\n Principal : A legitimate actor of any system. Credential(s) : An artifact(s) to provide identity. Authentication : The process through which an identity is associated with some principal. Authorization : A set of rights/permissions which a principal possesses. Threat : A specific means by which an attacker can put a system at risk. Threat model : A collection of threats that is deemed important for a particular environment. It can also be thought as a collection of attacker(s) abilities. Vulnerability : A systematic artifact that exposes the user, data, or system to a threat. Vulnerabilities are also known as attack vectors which an adversary (bad guy(s)) use to compromise a system. Common sources of vulnerability could be bad software/hardware design, bad policy/configuration, system misuse etc. Attack : An occurrence where a vulnerability is exploited by an adversary.
